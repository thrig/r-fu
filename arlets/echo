# r-fu arlet template - install to ARLET_DIR directory
#
# Simple example showing (optionally) how to read arguments passed in by r-fu.
#
#   $ r-fu echo hi there
#   [1] "hi"    "there"
#   $ r-fu --show-code echo foo
#   ...
#
# Note that the `cat` and `noquote` functions are handy to remove the cruft R
# adds to the output (the leading [x] bits and quotes) though there might be
# better ways to remove those I do not know about?
