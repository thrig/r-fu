r-fu arlets directory. These are templates that get filled in with options
or arguments to r-fu (plus perhaps configuration from an optional *.ini
file, along with any defaults from defaults.ini), then fed to R. See r-fu
for details of how R is run, then study the existing templates and check the
output of `r-fu --show-code ...` to audit that the template is being filled
in properly.

The template format is that of Text::Template.
