r-fu arlets directory. These are templates that get filled in with options or
arguments to r-fu (plus perhaps configuration from the optional *.conf file),

templates and check the output of `r-fu --show-code ...` to audit that the
template is being filled in properly.

The template format is detailed in Text::Xslate::Syntax::Kolon
