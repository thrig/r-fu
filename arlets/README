r-fu arlets directory. These are templates that get filled in with
options or arguments to r-fu (plus perhaps configuration from an
optional *.ini file, along with any defaults from defaults.ini), then
fed to R. See r-fu for details of how R is run, then study the existing
templates and check the output of `r-fu --show-code ...` to audit that
the template is being filled in properly.

The template format is that of Text::Template.

A ZShell trick for editing all of just the artlets with *.ini files is:

  $EDITOR *.ini(N:r)

which would obtain the root filename (:r) from any *.ini files, ignoring
failures (N). To select for just the arlets, assuming they being with a
lower case letter (to exclude this README, mostly):

  $EDITOR [a-z]*~*.*

This one needs the EXTENDED_GLOB option set.
