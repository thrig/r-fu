Graphs time complexity numbers in both normal and log-log form plus
reference graphs for linear, square, cubic, and quadratic fits. Sample
input data for the first file should contain something like:

  1000 0.0024
  2000 0.0077
  4000 0.0306
  8000 0.1258
  16000 0.4815
  32000 1.8844

where x was the number of thingies done and y the time it took to
perform the calculation on them. Output is to the second file on the
command line:
