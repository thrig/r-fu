boxplot data, minus the 1% and 99% (or custom limits as supplied) in the
event there is or are some extreme outliers that reneder the majority of
the data as a single point. Usage:

  r-fu boxplot199 datfile out.pdf
  ... | r-fu boxplot199 - out.pdf

Custom limits would run along the lines of:

  r-fu boxplot199 datfile out.pdf 0.25 0.75

NOTE that throwing out data skews the results. So this probably
should not be done without very good reasons.
