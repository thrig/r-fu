xy plot data with log/log axes (with lowess unless 'p'oints. Usage:

  r-fu xyloglog datfile out.pdf
  ... | r-fu xyloglog - out.pdf

  # 'p'oints instead of 'l'ines or the default 'b'oth
  r-fu xyloglog datfile out.pdf p

where the 'datfile' or standard input contains two columns of X and Y
data (R is picky about input, so leading and trailing whitespace may
need to be trimmed, and a single space used to delimit the data).
