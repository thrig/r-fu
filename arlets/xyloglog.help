xy plot data with log/log axes. Usage:

  r-fu xyloglog datfile out.pdf
  ... | r-fu xyloglog - out.pdf

where the 'datfile' or standard input contains two columns of X and Y
data (R is picky about input, so leading and trailing whitespace may
need to be trimmed, and a single space used to delimit the data).
