`r-fu` is a wrapper around R (http://www.r-project.org) that provides a means
to toss arbitrary data sets at named R code templates that are fed to R. See
the "arlets" directory for the available templates of R code.

Assuming that all the required Perl modules are installed from CPAN, a quick
test might look like:

  $ env ARLET_DIR=arlets ./r-fu echo test
  [1] "test"

While a proper install under a home directory might look something like:

  cp r-fu ~/bin

  # or some other dir and exporting ARLET_DIR, etc.
  mkdir ~/share
  cp -r arlets ~/share

  # only on ZSH, $fpath may need customization, etc.
  cp _r-fu $fpath[0]   

Or otherwise fiddle with the paths (and possibly the source code for the arlets
directory) if other paths are desired. Then read the docs on r-fu for more
information:

  perldoc r-fu

Motivation for this NIH system: other options, such as learning R more soas to
be comfortable in its REPL, or using some webby thing or knitr, do not suit the
Unix + Perl + C environment I spend most of my time in, and my prior practice
of copying and pasting random R commands from who knows where did not promote
proper scriptability.


Output Format Ruminations for the Curious
-----------------------------------------

Experimented with quartz rendering for Mac OS X:

  quartz(width=7, height=7, bg="white");
  quartzFonts(sans = quartzFont(rep("Verdana", 4)))
  ...
  quartz.save("r-out.png", type="png", device=dev.cur(), dpi=100)

though that flashes up a temporary screen when rendering, and steals focus
thereafter from the terminal, so is not ideal. PNG output includes thin, ugly
fonts, so avoiding that.

  png(file="r-out.png", bg="white", width=699, height=699)

PDF output looks decent, so going with that. This could, of course, be changed
by fiddling with the code in the arlets. Of course, the arlet code could emit
plaintext to standard out, or do whatever.
